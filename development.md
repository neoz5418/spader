# FastAPI Project - Development

## Local Development

The Docker Compose files are configured so that each of the services is available in a different port in `localhost`.

For the backend and frontend, they use the same port that would be used by their local development server, so, the backend is at `http://localhost:8000` and the frontend at `http://localhost:5173`.

This way, you could turn off a Docker Compose service and start its local development service, and everything would keep working, because it all uses the same ports.

For example, you can stop that `frontend` service in the Docker Compose, in another terminal, run:

```bash
docker compose stop frontend
```

And then start the local frontend development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Or you could stop the `backend` Docker Compose service:

```bash
docker compose stop backend
```

And then you can run the local development server for the backend:

```bash
cd backend
uv run main.py
```

## Generate TypeScript API Client

The project includes an automated process to generate TypeScript API client code from the backend's OpenAPI specification. This is handled by the `generate-client.sh` script in the `scripts` directory.

### How it works

The generation process consists of three main steps:

1. **OpenAPI Specification Generation**
   - Extracts OpenAPI specification from the FastAPI backend
   - Generates `openapi.json` file
   - Modifies operation IDs for better TypeScript naming

2. **Client Code Generation**
   - Uses Kubb to generate TypeScript client code
   - Creates type definitions, API client, and React Query hooks
   - Implements Zod schemas for runtime type validation
   - Formats generated code using Biome

3. **Cleanup**
   - Removes temporary files

### Configuration

The generation is configured through `frontend/kubb.config.ts`, which sets up:
- TypeScript type generation
- API client code generation
- React Query hooks with proper typing
- Zod validation schemas
- Custom naming transformations

### Usage

To generate the API client, run:

```bash
./scripts/generate-client.sh
```

This ensures that the frontend API client stays in sync with the backend API, providing:
- Type-safe API interactions
- Automated code generation
- Reduced manual maintenance
- Consistent interface between frontend and backend

## The .env file

The `.env` file is the one that contains all your configurations, generated keys and passwords, etc.

Depending on your workflow, you could want to exclude it from Git, for example if your project is public. In that case, you would have to make sure to set up a way for your CI tools to obtain it while building or deploying your project.

One way to do it could be to add each environment variable to your CI/CD system, and updating the `docker-compose.yml` file to read that specific env var instead of reading the `.env` file.

## Pre-commits and code linting

we are using a tool called [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for code linting and formatting.

When you install it, it runs right before making a commit in git. This way it ensures that the code is consistent and formatted even before it is committed.

You can find a file `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with configurations at the root of the project.

#### Install pre-commit to run automatically

`pre-commit` is already part of the dependencies of the project, but you could also install it globally if you prefer to, following [the official pre-commit docs](https://pre-commit.com/).

After having the `pre-commit` tool installed and available, you need to "install" it in the local repository, so that it runs automatically before each commit.

Using `uv`, you could do it with:

```bash
❯ uv run pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Now whenever you try to commit, e.g. with:

```bash
git commit
```

...pre-commit will run and check and format the code you are about to commit, and will ask you to add that code (stage it) with git again before committing.

Then you can `git add` the modified/fixed files again and now you can commit.

#### Running pre-commit hooks manually

you can also run `pre-commit` manually on all the files, you can do it using `uv` with:

```bash
❯ uv run pre-commit run --all-files
check for added large files..............................................Passed
check toml...............................................................Passed
check yaml...............................................................Passed
ruff.....................................................................Passed
ruff-format..............................................................Passed
eslint...................................................................Passed
prettier.................................................................Passed
```
